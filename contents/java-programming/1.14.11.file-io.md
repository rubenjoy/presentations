###  Part: Treating Files as Streams of Strings

---

### Topics in This Section

- More on try/catch blocks
  - finally, multicatch, try-with-resources
- Representing file paths
  - Paths.get
- Reading files by treating them as streams of strings
  - Files.lines
- Writing files
  - Files.write
- Exploring folders by treating them as streams of paths
  - Files.list, Files.walk, Files.find

---

### Quick Aside:
###### More on try/catch Blocks

- Covered earlier: basics

```java
try {
  statement1;
  statement2;
  ...
} catch(Eclass1 var1) {
  ...
} catch(Eclass2 var2) {
  ...
} catch(Eclass3 var3) {
  ...
}
```

---

###### More on try/catch Blocks

- New: finally

```java
try {...
} catch(...) {...
} finally {
...
}
```

- New: multicatch

```java
try {...
} catch(Eclass1 | Eclass e) {
...
} ...
```

- New: try with resources

```java
try (SomeAutoCloseable var = ...) {...
} catch(...) { ...
} ...
```

---

### Finally Blocks

- Idea
  - The finally { ... } block at the end of a try/catch is called whether or not there is an
exception
- Motivation: resetting resources, closing sockets, other cleanup

```java
HugeDataStructure blah = ...;
try {
  doSomethingWith(blah);
  ...
} catch {
  ...
} finally {
  blah = null;
}
```

---

### Finally Blocks: Benefits

- Question: difference between these two?

```java
try {
  ...
} catch(ExceptionType e) {
  ...
} finally {
  doSomeCleanup();
}
```

```java
try {
  ...
} catch(ExceptionType e) {
  ...
}
doSomeCleanup();
```

---

###### Finally Blocks: Benefits

- Answer: nested try/catch blocks
  - In the example on the 2nd code, if the catch throws an exception and the entire
try/catch block is inside another try/catch block, the cleanup code might not run
- Same issue if there is return, break, or continue
- Many developers advocate always using finally for required cleanup, even if code does
not (currently) have nested exception, return statement, etc.

---

### Multicatch

- Idea: can catch multiple exceptions using |
  - In Java 7 and later, if two different catch blocks will do the same thing, you can
catch more than one in the same catch clause (but also consider catching a parent
type):

```java
try { ... } catch(Eclass1 | Eclass2 e) { ... }
```

---

- Example

```java
// Without Multicatch
String input = getSomeString();
int num;
try {
  num = Integer.parseInt(input);
} catch(NumberFormatException nfe) {
  num = someDefault;
} catch(NullPointerException npe) {
  num = someDefault;
}

// With Multicatch
String input = getSomeString();
int num;
try {
  num = Integer.parseInt(input);
} catch(NumberFormatException | NullPointerException e) {
  num = someDefault;
}
```

---

### try-with-resources: Overview

- Idea
  - In Java 7 and later, you can declare variables that implement AutoCloseable in
parens after try.
- Scope of variable is scope of try/catch block
- The close method of each variable is called at the end, whether or not there is an
exception (i.e., as if the call to close were in a finally block)
- Can declare multiple variables, separated by semicolon
- Example:

```java
try (BufferedReader reader = ...) {
  readSomeDataWith(reader);
  ...
} catch(SomeExceptionType e) {
  ...
}
```

---

### try-with-resources

- Without

```java
BufferedReader reader;
try {
  reader = ...;
  ...
} catch(SomeExceptionType e) {
  ...
} finally {
  reader.close();
}
```


- with resources

```java
try(BufferedReader reader = ...) {
  ...
} catch(SomeExceptionType e) {
  ...
}
```

---

### try-with-resources: Benefits

- Shorter and simpler
- Can’t forget to call close
- The reader variable is out of scope after the try/catch block finishes

---

### Paths

- Path is a simpler and more flexible replacement for File class
  - And is main starting point for file I/O operations
- Get a Path with Paths.get

```java
Path p1 = Paths.get("some-file");
Path p2 = Paths.get("/usr/local/gosling/some-file");
Path p3 = Paths.get("C:\\Users\\Gosling\\Documents\\some-file");
// Notice the double backslashes above, because backslash already has meaning (escape next character) in Java strings
```

- Paths have convenient methods
  - toAbsolutePath, startsWith, endsWith, getFileName, getName, getNameCount,
subpath, getParent, getRoot, normalize, relativize

---

### Example

```java
public class PathExamples {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Path p1 = Paths.get("input-file.txt");
    System.out.println("Simple Path");
    System.out.printf("toString: %s%n%n", p1);
    Path p2 = p1.toAbsolutePath();
    System.out.println("Absolute Path");
    System.out.printf("toString: %s%n", p2);
    System.out.printf("getFileName: %s%n", p2.getFileName());
    System.out.printf("getName(0): %s%n", p2.getName(0));
    System.out.printf("getNameCount: %d%n", p2.getNameCount());
    System.out.printf("subpath(0,2): %s%n", p2.subpath(0,2));
    System.out.printf("getParent: %s%n", p2.getParent());
    System.out.printf("getRoot: %s%n", p2.getRoot());
  }
}

/**
 * Result
 * Simple Path
 * toString: input-file.txt
 * Absolute Path
 * toString: C:\eclipse-workspace\java\file-io\input-file.txt
 * getFileName: input-file.txt
 * getName(0): eclipse-workspace
 * getNameCount: 4
 * subpath(0,2): eclipse-workspace\java
 * getParent: C:\eclipse-workspace\java\file-io
 * getRoot: C:\
 */
```

---

### Using File.lines: Idea

- With one method call, you can produce a Stream of Strings

```java
Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(somePath);
```

- Benefits
  -  Can use all the cool and powerful Stream methods
    - map, filter, reduce, collect, etc.
  -  Lazy evaluation
    - Suppose you map into uppercase, filter out the strings shorter than five characters,
keep only the palindromes, then find the first
    - If there is a 5-letter palindrome near the top of the file, it will never even read the rest of
the file

---

### Files.lines: More Details

- Charset option

```java
Files.lines(path) //Uses UTF-8
Files.lines(path, someCharset) //Uses specified Charset
```

- Throws IOException
  - So, you must use try/catch block or throw the exception
- Stream should be closed
  - Most Streams do not need closing, but ones connected to I/O sources (as here) do
- Stream implements AutoCloseable
  - You can use try-with-resources to handle IOException and automatically call close()
at the end


---

### File Reading Variations

- General principle
  - Streams help make handling large data sets more convenient and efficient
  - Lambdas and generic types help make code more flexible and reusable
- Variation 1
  - Put all code inside main; main throws Exception
    - Simple and easy, but not reusable
- Variation 2 (next section)
  - Method 1 handles Stream; method 2 calls Files.lines and passes Stream to method 1
    - Reusable, but each version of method 2 repeats a lot of boilerplate code
- Variation 3 (next section)
  - Define a functional interface and a static method that can use lambdas
  - Method 1 handles Stream; method 2 passes filename and lambda to static method
- Variation 4 (next section)
  - Similar to variation 3 but uses generic types so that values can be returned

---

### File Reading

- Basic approach

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  Files.lines(Paths.get("input-file"))
    .map(someFunction)
    .filter(someTest)
    .someOtherStreamOperation(...);
}
```

- Advantage: quick and easy
  - Many data analysis tasks involve one-up cases to read and analyze log files
- Disadvantage: not reusable
  - Cannot do same task to Stream<String> that came from another source
  - Cannot test without a file
  - Calling main is inconvenient from other code

---

### Example 1:
###### Create File of 4-Letter Words

- Assume that the enable1 word list might have a few repeats, a few words in mixed case,
and a few words out of alphabetical order
- Produce file containing all four-letter words, in upper case, without repeats, and in
alphabetical order

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  String inputFile = "enable1-word-list.txt";
  String outputFile = "four-letter-words.txt";
  int length = 4;
  List<String> words =
  Files.lines(Paths.get(inputFile))
    .filter(word -> word.length() == length)
    .map(String::toUpperCase)
    .distinct()
    .sorted()
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
  Files.write(Paths.get(outputFile), words, Charset.defaultCharset());
  System.out.printf("Wrote %s words to %s.%n", words.size(), outputFile);
}

/**
 * Result
 * AAHS
 * AALS
 * ABAS
 * ABBA
 * ABBE
 * ...
 * Wrote 3903 words to four-letter-words.txt.
 */
```

---

### Example 2:
###### All palindromes

- Print out all palindromes contained in the file

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  String inputFile = "enable1-word-list.txt";
  Files.lines(Paths.get(inputFile))
    .filter(StringUtils::isPalindrome)
    .forEach(System.out::println);
}

/**
 * Result
 * aa
 * aba
 * abba
 * aga
 * aha
 * ...
 */
```

---

### Example 3:
###### Print First 6-Letter Palindrome

- Print the first 6-letter palindrome contained in the file

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  String inputFile = "enable1-word-list.txt";
  String firstPalindrome =
    Files.lines(Paths.get(inputFile))
      .filter(word -> word.length() == 6)
      .filter(StringUtils::isPalindrome)
      .findFirst()
      .orElse(null);
  System.out.printf("First 6-letter palindrome is %s.%n", firstPalindrome);
}

/**
 * Result
 * First 6-letter palindrome is denned.
 */
```

---

### Example 4:
###### # of Words with q not Followed by u

- Count how many words have q but no qu

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  String inputFile = "enable1-word-list.txt";
  long wordCount =
    Files.lines(Paths.get(inputFile))
      .filter(word -> word.contains("q"))
      .filter(word -> !word.contains("qu"))
      .count();
  System.out.printf("%s words with q but not u.%n", wordCount);
}

/**
 * Result
 * 29 words with q but not u.
 */
```

---

### Example 5:
###### Total Letters in Words with Both x & y

-  Count total letters in all words that have both x and y

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  String inputFile = "enable1-word-list.txt";
  int letterCount =
  Files.lines(Paths.get(inputFile))
    .filter(word -> word.contains("x"))
    .filter(word -> word.contains("y"))
    .mapToInt(String::length)
    .sum();
  System.out.printf("%,d total letters in words with " + "both x and y.%n", letterCount);
}

/*
 * Result
 * 8,556 total letters in words with both x and y.
 */
```

---

### Preview of Later Variations

**General principle**
- Streams help make handling large data sets more convenient and efficient
  - This was seen even in this first variation that uses Files.lines to get Stream<String>
  - Use of convenient Stream methods makes it relatively easy to do complex file reading
tasks. Arguably as convenient as Python and Perl.
  - Lazy evaluation and the fact that Streams are not stored in memory all at once makes
file processing efficient.
- Lambdas and generic types help make code more flexible and reusable
  - In examples so far, code was not easily reusable
  - Variations 2 and especially 3 will show how lambdas can help
  - Variation 4 will show how generic types can help further
  - Followon examples will show how advanced lambda processing (combining
predicates) can easily apply to file processing

---

### Simple File Writing

- You can write all lines in one method call

```java
List<String> lines = ...;
Files.write(somePath, lines, someCharset);
```

- You can write all bytes in one method call

```java
byte[] fileArray = ...;
Files.write(somePath, fileArray);
```

---

### The OpenOption

- Both versions of Files.write optionally take an OpenOption as final argument

```java
Files.write(somePath, lines, someCharset, someOption);
Files.write(somePath, fileArray, someOption);
```

- Motivation
  - Lets you specify whether to create file if it doesn’t exist, whether to overwrite or
append, and so forth
  - Default behavior is to create file if not there and to overwrite if it is there

---

### Example 1: Write Strings to File

```java
public class WriteFile1 {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Charset characterSet = Charset.defaultCharset();
    Path path = Paths.get("output-file-1.txt");
    List<String> lines = Arrays.asList("Line One", "Line Two", "Final Line");
    Files.write(path, lines, characterSet);
  }
}

/**
 * Source of output-file-1.txt after execution
 * Line One
 * Line Two
 * Final Line
 */
```

---

### Faster and More Flexible File Writing
- You often need to format Strings
  - Files.write does not let you format the Strings as you insert them into the file
- Need higher performance for very large files
  - You do not want to store everything in memory as List all at once
  - Buffered writing writes in blocks, and is faster for very large files
- Shortcut method for getting BufferedWriter

```java
Writer w = Files.newBufferedWriter(somePath, someCharset);
w.write(...);
```

- You usually wrap PrintWriter around the Writer
  - Writer has only simple write method, but you can do

```java
PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(yourBufferedWriter);
```

then use the print, println, and especially printf methods of PrintWriter ->  out.printf(...);

---

### Example 1: BufferedWriter Only

```java
public class WriteFile2 {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    Charset characterSet = Charset.defaultCharset();
    int numLines = 10;
    Path path = Paths.get("output-file-2.txt");
    try (BufferedWriter writer =
      Files.newBufferedWriter(path, characterSet)) {
        for(int i=0; i<numLines; i++) {
          writer.write("Number is " + 100 * Math.random());
          writer.newLine();
        }
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
      System.err.printf("IOException: %s%n", ioe);
    }
}

/**
 * Source of output-file-2.txt after execution
 * Number is 81.4612317643326
 * Number is 52.38736740877531
 * Number is 71.76545597068544

 * Number is 35.59135386659128
 * Number is 89.43130746540979
 */
```

---

### Example 2: PrintWriter

```java
public class WriteFile3 {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    Charset characterSet = Charset.defaultCharset();
    int numLines = 10;
    Path path = Paths.get("output-file-3.txt");
    try (PrintWriter out =
      new PrintWriter(Files.newBufferedWriter(path, characterSet))) {
        for(int i=0; i<numLines; i++) {
          out.printf("Number is %5.2f%n", 100 * Math.random());
        }
    } catch (IOException ioe) {
      System.err.printf("IOException: %s%n", ioe);
    }
  }
}

/**

 * Number is 96.51
 * Number is 5.27

### Exploring Folders by Treating Them as Streams of Paths
###### Idea

- Get all files in a folder
  - Files.list
- Get all files in and below a folder
  - Files.walk
- Get matching files in and below a folder
  - Files.find
    - With Files.walk above, you usually manually apply a Predicate by using filter, and thus
only process certain files.
    - Files.find simplifies that: you also pass in a BiPredicate that takes a Path and a
BasicFileAttributes object, and Files.find returns only the Paths that pass the test.

---

### Example 1:
###### Printing Files in Folder

```java
public class FolderUtils {
    public static void printAllPaths(Stream<Path> paths) {
      paths.forEach(System.out::println);
    }

    public static void printAllPathsInFolder(String folder) {
      try(Stream<Path> paths = Files.list(Paths.get(folder))) {
        printAllPaths(paths);
      } catch(IOException ioe) {
        System.err.println("IOException: " + ioe);
      }
    }

    public static void printPaths(Stream<Path> paths, Predicate<Path> test) {
      paths.filter(test)
           .forEach(System.out::println);
    }

    public static void printPathsInFolder(String folder, Predicate<Path> test) {
      try(Stream<Path> paths = Files.list(Paths.get(folder))) {
        printPaths(paths, test);
      } catch(IOException ioe) {
        System.err.println("IOException: " + ioe);
      }
    }

    ... 
    
    public static void listExamples() {
        System.out.println("All files in project root");
        FolderUtils.printAllPathsInFolder(".");
        System.out.println("Text files in project root");
        FolderUtils.printPathsInFolder(".",
        p -> p.toString().endsWith(".txt"));
    }

    /**
     * Result
     * All files in project root
     * .\.classpath
     * .\.project
     * .\.settings
     * .\coreservlets

     * .\output-file-3.txt
     * .\unixdict.txt
     */
```

### Example 2:
###### Printing Files in Tree

```java
  public static void printAllPathsInTree(String rootFolder) {
    try(Stream<Path> paths = Files.walk(Paths.get(rootFolder))) {
      printAllPaths(paths);
    } catch(IOException ioe) {
      System.err.println("IOException: " + ioe);
    }
  }

  public static void printPathsInTree(String rootFolder, Predicate<Path> test) {
    try(Stream<Path> paths = Files.walk(Paths.get(rootFolder))) {
      printPaths(paths, test);
    } catch(IOException ioe) {
      System.err.println("IOException: " + ioe);
    }
  }

  ...

  public static void walkExamples() {
      System.out.println("All files under project root");
      FolderUtils.printAllPathsInTree(".");
      System.out.println("Java files under project root");
      FolderUtils.printPathsInTree(".", p -> p.toString().endsWith(".java"));
  }

/**

```

### Example 3:
###### Printing Matching Files in Tree

```java
  public static void findPathsInTree(String rootFolder, BiPredicate<Path,BasicFileAttributes> test) {
    try(Stream<Path> paths = Files.find(Paths.get(rootFolder), 10, test)) {
      printAllPaths(paths);
    } catch(IOException ioe) {
      System.err.println("IOException: " + ioe);
    }
  }

  ...

  public static void findExamples() {
    System.out.println("Java files under project root");
    FolderUtils.findPathsInTree(".",
        (path,attrs) -> path.toString().endsWith(".java"));
    System.out.println("Folders under project root");
    FolderUtils.findPathsInTree(".",
        (path,attrs) -> attrs.isDirectory());
    System.out.println("Large files under project root");

### Summary: try/catch Blocks

- finally blocks

```java
try { ...
} catch(SomeExceptionType e) { ...
} finally {
...
}
```

- multicatch

```java
try {...
} catch(ExceptionType1 | ExceptionType2 e) {
...
}
```

- try with resources

```java
try (SomeAutoCloseable var = ...) { ...
} catch(SomeExceptionType e) { ...
}
```

---

### Summary: File I/O in Java 8

- Use Path to refer to file location
  - Path somePath = Paths.get("/path/to/file.txt");
- Read all lines into a Stream
  - Can now use filter, map, distinct, sorted, findFirst, collect, etc.
  - You get benefits of lazy evaluation
  - In next section, we will make the code more reusable, flexible, and testable

```java
Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(somePath);
```

- Write List or other Iterable into a file

```java
Files.write(somePath, someList, someCharset);
```

---

###### Summary: File I/O in Java 8

- Get Writer for more flexible output

```java
Files.newBufferedWriter(somePath, someCharset)
// Use write method, or, more often, wrap in PrintWriter and use printf
```


- Explore and search folders and subfolders
  - Files.list, Files.walk, Files.find
