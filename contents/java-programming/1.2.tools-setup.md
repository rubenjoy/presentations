# Part 2 Tools Setup

- Maven
- Git
- Unit Test

---

## Maven

- Is a Java build tool (project, dependency management)
- Used for Java projects
- Adopt convention over configuration
- Under Apache Software Foundation (mostly supported by SonaType)

## Java builds

Build Tools Advantages

- Portability
- Automation
- Repeatability

---

## Mindset

- All build systems are essentially the same:
  - Compile Source code
  - Copy Resource
  - Compile and Run Tests
  - Package Project
  - Deploy Project
  - Cleanup
- Describe the project and configure the build
  - You don’t script a build
  - Maven has no concept of a condition
  - Plugins are configured

---

## How does it works?

- Build configured using pom.xml file
- POM = Project Object Model
- Uses standard build order, project layout
- Identifies dependencies in the pom.xml file
- POM can call child POM's

## Setup & Install

- Download [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Extract to local directory e.g. `C:\maven` or `/opt/maven`
- Create or modify `PATH` environment variable to include maven executable e.g. `c:\maven\bin`
- Test maven with command `mvn -v`

```

## POM Structure

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
         http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">

    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.mitrais.training</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-training</artifactId>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
    <version>1.0</version>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>

        <dependency>

        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>
```

## GroupId
- A group ID is a universally unique identifier for a project. While this is often just the project name (eg. commons-collections), it is helpful to use a fully-qualified package name to distinguish it from other projects with a similar name (eg. org.apache.maven).
- groupId will identify your project uniquely across all projects, so we need to enforce a naming schema. It has to follow the package name rules, what means that has to be at least as a domain name you control, and you can create as many subgroups as you want.

---

## ArtifactId
- An artifact is something that is either produced or used by a project. Examples of artifacts produced by Maven for a project include: JARs, source and binary distributions, WARs. Each artifact is uniquely identified by a group id and an artifact ID which is unique within a group
- artifactId is the name of the jar without version. If you created it then you can choose whatever name you want with lowercase letters and no strange symbols. If it's a third party jar you have to take the name of the jar as it's distributed. eg. maven, commons-math

---

## Packaging
- Packaging in maven defines the artifact that will be produced by maven and the "maven package" goal is the one that will compile the code, gather the resources, run the unit tests and build a deployable artefact (JAR, WAR, EAR, etc.)
- The products of Maven are always written to the "target" directory.

---

## Dependencies
- Most every project depends upon others to build and run correctly
- Maven lists all the dependencies of every project and its transitive dependencies, allowing your list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.

---

## Dependency Scope
- This element refers to the classpath of the task at hand (compiling and runtime, testing, etc.) as well as how to limit the transitivity of a dependency. There are five scopes available:
    - compile
    - provided
    - runtime
    - test
    - system

---

## Archetype
- Maven project templating toolkit
- syntax "mvn archetype:generate"
- Maven Quickstart archetype
    - mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=5-SNAPSHOT

---

## Maven Phase
- General build tasks
    - mvn clean
    - mvn validate
    - mvn compile
    - mvn test
    - mvn package
    - mvn verify
    - mvn install
    - mvn deploy
- Optionally, specify multiple build tasks
    - mvn clean install
